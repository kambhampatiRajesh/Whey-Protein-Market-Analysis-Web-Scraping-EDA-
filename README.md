# 🏋️‍♂️ Whey Protein Market Analysis

**Web Scraping & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Python**

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on collecting real-world whey protein product data from online sources using web scraping techniques and performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover market trends, pricing strategies, brand performance, and customer preferences in the fitness supplement industry.

##  Data Collection (Web Scraping)

* Scraped product data using **BeautifulSoup** and **Requests**
* Extracted attributes such as product name, brand, price, rating, review count, and protein type
* Converted unstructured web data into a structured tabular format

##  Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

* Removed duplicates and missing values
* Standardized brand names and categories
* Converted price and rating columns to numeric formats
* Handled outliers for meaningful analysis

##  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed price distribution across brands
* Identified top-performing brands based on ratings and reviews
* Studied the relationship between price and customer ratings
* Visualized insights using **Matplotlib** and **Seaborn**

##  Key Insights

* Premium products do not always receive higher ratings
* Mid-range brands often show strong customer satisfaction
* A small number of brands dominate customer reviews
* Price and perceived value play a major role in buyer behavior

##  Technologies Used

* Python
* BeautifulSoup
* Requests
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Google Colab
